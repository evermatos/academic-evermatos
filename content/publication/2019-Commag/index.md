abstract = "Security issues represent the greatest obstacle to the growth of edge computing and the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paradigm, IoT applications are migrating to edge devices. As a result, potential security risks are arising, and unauthorized access to data from IoT edge devices is becoming a real concern. Thus, there is a need for a comprehensive, end-toend security approach since the system's more vulnerable point determines its overall security level. An edge device security system has to be built with a root of trust (i.e., something that is unclonable) and a chain of trust. Additionally, a security layer is necessary to ensure that different IoT applications execute isolated from each other in the device. In this sense, this article defines a security architecture that integrates trust mechanisms with embedded virtualization, providing security from hardware to applications. Our experiments show that the proposed architecture can be implemented with a smaller overhead and memory footprint compared to other proposed approaches in the literature, which makes it highly suitable for resource-constrained edge devices."
